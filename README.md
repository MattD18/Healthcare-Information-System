NYC Hospital Recomendation System

Matthew Dalton (mgd67) and Katelyn Glassman (kmg237)

Our project goal is to develop a model to determine which hospitals in NYC are equipped to handle specific medical conditons the best. To do this we will initially be examining hospital discharge data from the year 2012 with a specific focus on the conditon of patients when they arrived, how long they stayed at the hospital, and the outcome of the treatment they received. In developing our model, we will examine how patient age, gender, and sex, as well as hospital information like its geographic location, affect those factors.
