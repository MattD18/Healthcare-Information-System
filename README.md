Our project goal is to develop a tool to provide hospital patients with predictions for their expected outcome, duration of stay at the hospital, and total cost, given their specific diagnosis. To do this we will be examining hospital discharge data from the year 2012, which also includes demographic information such as patient age, gender, and race, as well as hospital information like geographic location.  We think that this is a relevant dataset to examine because we feel there may likely be a correlation between these demographic factors and our target predictators.
