NYC Hospital Recomendation System

Matthew Dalton (mgd67) and Katelyn Glassman (kmg237)

Our project goal is to develop a model to determine which hospitals in NYC are equipped to handle specific medical conditons the best. The criteria that we are focusing on are ratio of severity of condition to length of stay, costs incurred, and patient outcome. To do this we will be examining hospital discharge data from the year 2012, which also includes demographic information such as patient age, gender, and race, as well as hospital information like geographic location.  We think that this is a relevant dataset to examine because we feel there may likely be a correlation between these demographic factors and quality of treatment.
